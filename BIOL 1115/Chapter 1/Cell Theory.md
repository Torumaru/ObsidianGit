Cell theory states
- All organisms are made of cells
- all cells come from pre-existing cells

Testing Cell theory
- microscope invented in the 1600's allowing observations of cells
- Experimental data showed all cells come from pre-existing cells by boiling a swain flask filled with chicken broth
- they discovered that only the chicken broth with access to air would grow cells verifying all cells come from preexisting cells

Importance of the cell theory
- Supports 2 of the 5 characteristics of life
	- Cells: all organisms that have ever been observed have compartments that match the definition of cells
	- Reproduction: for cells to arise from pre-existing cells, cells must replicate
- Cell theory also set the stage for hypotheses regarding the source of biological diversity on the planet 
	- see also [[Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection]]

A Cell is a highly organized membrane-bound compartment
- Robert Hooke observed compartments in cork tissue to describe cells
- has the ability to store and transmit information
- Can harness energy from the environment to power metabolic functions
- Enclosed by a plasma membrane that separates contents within the cell from the nonliving environment around it
	- Controls the exchange of material between the cell and the environment
	- Some cells have internal membranes that divide the cell into compartments

Prokaryote - lacks nucleus

Eukaryote - has nucleus
