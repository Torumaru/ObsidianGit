- This theory propses that cells contain hereditary information that is encoded in genes, which are in turn located on chromosomes
	- Chromosomes and their movements during cell division were first described by **Walter Flemming in the late 1800's
	- The connection between chromosomes and heredity was first hypothesized by **Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri** in 1902

How did this idea become a theory
- Observations of cells undergoing meiosis
- Experimental data
	- Thomas Hunt Morgan performed breeding experiments with fruit flies which showed that specific traits correlated with specific chromosomes

Structure of DNA and chromosomes
- 1950's Francis Watson and Walter Crick interpreted x-ray images obtained by Rosalind Franklin to determine the structure of the genetic material within chromosomes
	- They concluded that the material DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) was a double-stranded helix
- Each strand of DNA is composed of 4 different kinds of molecules called nucleotides, connected in a long chain
	- 4 nucleotides are
		- Adenine (A)
		- Thymine (T)
		- Cytosine (C)
		- Guanine (G)

- Gene - DNA sequence that corresponds to a specific protein
	- For the Gene to be expressed the information must first go through an intermediate molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid)
	- Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein
- DNA and RNA are composed of nucleotides
- proteins are composed of amino acids

- Transcription - process by which information in DNA is rewritten as RNA
- Translation - process by which a cell makes protein using the information carried in RNA
	- Nucleotide 'language' to amino acid ' language'

- proteins are important because they do everything

DNA organization and storage
- Multiple genes are located on each long strand of DNA
	- each DNA strand is condensed into a chromosome
- Chromosomes are stored in
	- Nucleus of eukaryotic cells
	- nucleoid region of prokaryotic cells

Importnence of the chromosome theory of inheritance
- Information encoded in DNA, which is expressed as proteins, controls many traits of an organism - these are the traits that are acted on by natural selection
	- see [[Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection]]
- This theory connects 4 characteristics of life to one another: cells, reproduction, evolution, and information
- The central dogma is the theory of how genetic information is transferred from DNA t RNA to protein

Life requires energy
- Chemical reactions that sustain life take place inside cells and require energy
	- Term metabolism describes all chemical reactions involved in maintaining the living state of the cells and organism
- Organisms have two nutritional needs
	- Acquiring chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
	- Obtaining molecules that can be used as building blocks to make DNA, RNA, proteins, etc
- Organisms acquire energy from two sources: the sun and chemical compounds
