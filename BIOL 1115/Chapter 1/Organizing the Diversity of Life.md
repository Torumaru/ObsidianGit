Life is diverse
	[[Characteristics of Life]]
- Within the boundaries of these criteria lies a **huge amount of diversity**

Phylogenetic Trees
- Evolutionary theory predicts that life's diversity has arisen by the divergence of populations over time
	- Closely related species are more likely to resemble one another than distantly related species
	- species that share several traits are grouped together
	- We can model these proposed relationships among different groups of organisms (taxa) using phylogenetic trees
	- therefore, a phylogenetic tree is an illustration of a hypothesis about the relationship among taxa

**The Three Domains of Life**

Domains- most inclusive level of taxonomic classification
- Bacteria are the most diverse and widespread prokaryotes
- Archaea are prokaryotes that often live in extreme environments
- Eukarya includes all eukaryotic life forms, both single-celled and multicellular

Level of biological classification
![[Pasted image 20250110171307.png]]
Right more diverse - Left more specific

- Most exclusive level of taxonomic categories that are used to classify organisms are **genus and species**
	- A genus is a group of closely related group of species
	- A species is a group of individuals that regularly breed together and have characteristics that are distinct from those other species
- Genus and species are combined to give an organism's its scientific name, a classification system first presented by Carolus Linnaeus
- genus is first with a capital followed by species with lowercase
