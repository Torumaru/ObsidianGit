Scientific method - systematic method to gather knowledge
	Observation - must be testable statement
	Questions - based on observation
	Hypothesis - tentative answers
	Prediction - measurable and observable results you expect to see from an experiment or                            future observations if your hypothesis is valid
	Test - possibility of yielding data that may or may not match the prediction
- If the results and prediction match, hypothesis is supported (but not proven)
- if the results and prediction do not match, the hypothesis is rejected
	Reporting results and peer review process - after properly conducting experiment and analyzing the data, finding and conclusions should be reported through publication in scientific journals
	- Reliable journals use the peer review process to unsure the experiment and data analysis were well conducted
- Hypotheis is a educated guess while a theory is a supported hypothesis with extensive data supporting it
