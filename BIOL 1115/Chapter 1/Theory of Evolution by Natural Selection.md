- This theory proposes all species have arisen from a common ancestry due to mutations where modifications are due to natural selection
	- Species are descended from a common ancestor
	- Species can be modified from generation to generation
- Simplified to descent with modification
- Natural selection is a mechanism that drives evolution
- Proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858

- Species - distinct, identifiable type of organism
- Population - group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time
- Fitness - ability of an individual to produce offspring
- Adaptation - trait that increases the fitness of a individual in a particular environment

In order for natural selection to occur
- Individuals must vary in characteristics that are heritable
- In a particular environment, certain versions of these heritable traits help individuals reproduce more than other versions
If certain heritable traits lead to increased success in producing offspring then these traits become more common in the population over time

How did the theory of natural selection become a theory
- Observations of numerous species in numerous locations
- eg. different species of finches were similar in appearance expect for their beaks which were correlated with the food sources in their given habitats

Why is this theory important in biology

This theory relies on two characteristics of life
- Cells - living organisms are composed of cells that have arisen from pre-existing cells, which is how all life can share a common ancestry
	- see [[Cell Theory]]
- Reproduction - reproduction is required for population to have future generations that may be different due to evolution
This theory leads us to two more characteristics of life
- Evolution - populations of organisms evolve over time
- Information - for traits to be passed down through generations, they must be encoded as a hereditary information
	- see [[Chromosome Theory of Inheritance]]
