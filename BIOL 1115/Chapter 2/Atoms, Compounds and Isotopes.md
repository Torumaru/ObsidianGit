Matter - consist of chemical elements in pure forms and in combination
- Physical Properties
	- Mass
	- Volume
	- Boling point/Melting points
- Chemical properties
	- Reactivity
	- Flammability
	- Toxicity
- Energy is not matter
Element - a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions
Compounds - substance consisting of two or more elements in a fixed ratio
- compounds has characteristics different from those of its elements
Organisms are composed of matter, which consists of chemical elements in pure form or in compounds
- organisms are composed of different chemical elements and compound
Essential elements of life - Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen make up 96% of living matter
- A few other elements make up the remaining 4%  of living matter
	- Most of the remaining 4% consists of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur
- Trace elements are required by an organism in only minute quantities
Atom - element consists of unique atoms
- atom is smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an elements
- composed of subatomic particles

Chemical bonds and chemical reaction difference
- Chemical bonds are the attractions that hold atoms together, while chemical reactions are processes that involve

dissociate
