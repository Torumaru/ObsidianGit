Procedural abstraction

If the program is well designed a function can be used as a black box

If the function is well designed a function can be reused: the values of the parameters vary

with functions, code duplication can be avoided

easier to maintain

there is no need to know about the implementation details

details of the implementation are encapsulated in the function and hidden from the client who calls the function

General idea of information
